# A repository for the translation of tockCSP into Timed Automata

Translation of tock-CSP to Timed Automata for UPPAAL
This is repository for the work on translatiing tock-CSP to Timed Automata for UPPAAL.

The repository contains:

1- A report for the translation work (pdf file).

2- A software for automating the translation technique.

3- Other relevant materials for both trace analysis and performance analysis.


NOTE:
Running the translation tool requires Haskell compiler because the application was developed with Haskell. While generating traces require FDR and UPPAAL. UPPAAL tool is included in the translation tool, but FDR is not included. Therefore FDR needs to be installed in the system before running the application.
